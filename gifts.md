		<h3>An Amana Tradition</h3>
		<p>It's tradition in the Amanas for guests to bring a dessert, often cake, to a couple's wedding instead of gifts. The desserts are displayed for everyone to see, and then sliced up and shared among the guests after dinner. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
		<h3>Our Request</h3>
		<p>We know cake doesn't travel well, and is hard to send in the mail. </p>
        <p>We've sent blank recipe cards in the invitations so you can bring us 
        your favorite dessert in a way we can treasure it forever! We would love to get 
        your recipe even if you can't attend in person. </p>
        <p> We'll display any recipes we get with your RVSPs at the reception! </p>

		<h3>Extra Cards</h3>
		<p>Don't worry if you have more than one favorite or the card meets an 
        unfortunate end, we'll have more cards at the reception and can mail 
        more to you when we're back from our honeymoon! </p>

		<h3>If you insist...</h3>
		<p>Participating in this tradition is how we prefer you show your love and celebration in our marriage! But if you insist on further showering us, below a way for you to help us have an unforgettable honeymoon experience.</p>
