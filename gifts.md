It's tradition in the Amanas for guests to bring a dessert, often cake, to a couple's wedding instead of gifts. The desserts are displayed for everyone to see, and then sliced up and shared among the guests after dinner. 

We know cake doesn't travel well, and is hard to send in the mail. We're including blank recipe cards in the invitations so you can bring us your favorite dessert in a way we can treasure it forever! We would love to get your recipe even if you can't attend. Don't worry if you have more than one favorite or the card meets an unfortunate end, we'll have more cards on site and can send some extra to those who can't attend! 

Participating in this tradition is how we prefer you show your love and celebration in our marriage! But if you insist on further showering us, we will include a way for you to help us have an unforgettable honeymoon experience on this page.
