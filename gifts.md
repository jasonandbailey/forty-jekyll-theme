It's tradition in the Amanas for guests to bring cake to a couple's wedding instead of gifts. 

We know cake doesn't travel well, and is hard to send in the mail, so we're sending blank recipe cards with the invitations so you can bring us your favorite dessert in a way we can treasure it forever! Don't worry if you have more than one favorite or the card meets an unfortunate end, we'll have more cards on site! 

Participating in this tradition is how we prefer you show your love and celebration in our marriage! But if you insist on further showering us, we've included a way for you to help us have an unforgettable honeymoon experience.
